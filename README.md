# project_vacourts

The goal is to extract criminal cases from the Virginia courts website
https://eapps.courts.state.va.us/gdcourts

As the website doesn't communicate using data. But sends pages/HTML

- to install requirements for this project: pip install -r requirements.txt

See 'main.py' for how to use the script for testing 'https://www.g2.com/products/melio/reviews'
